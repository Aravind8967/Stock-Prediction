=========================== Use of data spliting while training model =============================================================================

1. Purpose of Data Splitting

    Training Set (80%):

        What It Is:
            The majority of your data used to teach the model.

            Purpose:
            The model “learns” patterns from this data by adjusting its weights during training.

            Validation Set (10%):

        What It Is:
            A separate portion of data not used for training.

        Purpose:

            To tune hyperparameters (like learning rate, number of layers, etc.).

            To monitor performance during training (for example, using early stopping).

            To check for overfitting, ensuring the model doesn’t just memorize the training data.

    Test Set (10%):

        What It Is:
            The final subset, kept completely separate from training and validation.

        Purpose:
            To evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data once training is complete.

2. Why These Specific Splits (80%-10%-10%)?
    
    80% Training:

        Provides ample data for the model to learn from, ensuring it captures the underlying trends and patterns.

    10% Validation and 10% Testing:

        These smaller sets are enough to reliably assess the model’s performance and detect overfitting, without reducing the amount of data available for training too much.

3. How These Splits Are Used in Model Training
    During Training:

        The model is fit on the training set, meaning it updates its parameters based on the errors it makes on this data.

        After each epoch (a complete pass over the training data), the model’s performance is evaluated on the validation set.

        Early stopping and learning rate adjustments often depend on validation performance, helping to prevent overfitting.

    After Training:

        The test set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model.

        It gives you a realistic picture of how your model might perform on real, unseen data.


Summary

    Training Set (80%): Used to learn the model.

    Validation Set (10%): Used to tune the model and monitor performance.

    Test Set (10%): Used for final evaluation of how the model generalizes.

By using these splits, you ensure that your model is robust, not overfitting the training data, and performs well on new, unseen data.
